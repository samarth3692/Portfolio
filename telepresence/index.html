           Telepresence attendance at academic conferences is now a reality where we are beginning to see conferences explore remote attendance via telepresence robots. While the experience is possible, we still have only an initial understanding of how attendance via telepresence robots should be best organized and designed, and how this effects the experience of the remote attendees. To date, telepresence attendance at academic conferences has typically focused on very small numbers of remote attendees (e.g., no more than seven) and a limited range of activities (e.g., only conference talks).

           <br><br>

          <div style="font-size:1.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 200%;">PROCESS</div>
          <b> Research Goals</b><br>
          As part of the ACM Conference on Computer Supported
Cooperative Work and Social Computing 2016 (CSCW),
we studied telepresence attendance to gain a deeper and
more nuanced understanding of remote conference
attendance via telepresence robots (Figure 1). CSCW 2016
had approximately 750 in-person attendees and contained
weekend workshops and a doctoral consortium, three days
of conference talks across five parallel sessions, a demo and
poster reception, and a conference reception. The goal of
our study was to explore how remote attendees participated
in conference paper sessions, breaks, workshops, and
receptions using BeamPro telepresence robots. <br><br>

 <img src="../img/beam2.png" width="80%" class="img-responsive center-block"/>

<br><br>
 <b> Data Collection and Analysis</b><br>
 A. Observations<br>
I observed the remote attendees throughout the
conference, during sessions, breaks, and at the demo
reception. During these sessions, observers took notes about where the Beam parked, how
they moved through the session, whether or not they asked
questions, and if and how they interacted with people. I
recorded images and videos at various points to capture the
different types of setups and interactions that occurred.

<br><br>
 B. Semi-Structured Interview<br>
 To gain detailed feedback on their experience, we
conducted interviews with each remote attendee within
several days of the end of the conference over Skype. Our interview questions focused on
Beam personalization, Beam sharing, navigation using the
colored maps and balloons, social interactions, and
potential privacy concerns. In addition, we interviewed one
workshop organizer (O1) to understand her experience of
having a remote attendee in the workshop. All interviews
were audio-recorded and transcribed. We used thematic analysis to understand
the main themes within our data. This involved multiple
reviews of interview transcriptions and meetings amongst
the paper authors to discuss their observations.

<br><br>
 C. Backchannel Messaging<br>
We kept logs of the messages in the Skype backchannel and
performed coding on a per-message basis to identify the
type of content in the message (e.g., technical question,
social comment). We also coded each message according to
who was the sender and the (most likely) intended recipient
(e.g., support staff, another remote attendee, everybody in
the chat channel). Our goal was to understand the main uses
of the backchannel and what types of conversational
exchanges occurred

<br><br>
 D. Post-Conference Survey<br>


As part of the general conference survey, we asked local
attendees for their feedback on the telepresence setup.
Questions focused on people’s first reactions to the Beams,
their impression at the end of the conference, how they felt
about shared vs. dedicated Beams, what value they saw in
having the Beams available for the different conference
activities (e.g., talks, receptions, workshops), and what they
would change, if anything, for future conferences.

 <br><br>

          <div style="font-size:1.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 200%;">OUTCOME</div>

        In this study, we explored a broader set of participation across conference events and an increased numbers of participants. We also explored a differing telepresence setup, which included the use of both dedicated and shared telepresence robots. Together, these differences allowed us to explore a broader set of circumstances.
We found similar challenges for remote attendees at CSCW
2016 when compared to Ubicomp/ISWC 2014. In this
way, our work validates prior study results with increased
numbers of participants and conference activities (e.g.,
receptions, breaks). Similarities included difficulties
navigating in tight spaces; difficulties seeing presentation
slides unless one was parked near the front of the room;
challenges using eye contact and body language when
communicating during breaks; a lack feedback of audio
levels; additional social attention because of the novelty of
the Beams; and, privacy issues from local attendees being
able to see into remote attendees’ homes. 
<br><br>
Second, we found
important differences with past research that were
elucidated by having broader remote participation at
CSCW. The remainder of our discussion focuses in on these
findings and their implications for future telepresence
attendance at academic conferences along with
corresponding design implications.
<br><br>
 We made
personalization a requirement at CSCW and, for those who
did not choose to personalize, we added a default
personalization (colored balloon). This largely worked
well, yet the setup also created challenges. Personalization
was done through physical objects as opposed to digital
ones. This made them highly noticeable but increased work
for remote attendees and support staff, given the number of
remote attendees. 

<br><br>
Appropriation: We had imagined that telepresence attendance would
follow a model of participation that we had established as
the telepresence organizers. However, it was evident very
quickly that telepresence attendance was much more about
appropriation and allowing the remote attendees to decide
how to best make use of the opportunity that Beams
afforded them. The implication is that telepresence attendance should be
considered a flexible option to support a multitude of
different situations. This suggests that a ‘one size fits all’
model is not good enough when it comes to the design of
telepresence robots.

    	  		<br><span id="med">Past Experience</span><br>
            A study was conducted on telepresence experience in Ubicomp/ISWC 2014. Key learning from this study are: <br>
    	  		- Remote attendance  saves time and cost.<br>
            - It was difficult for remote attendees to represent their identity within the robots<br> 
            - Poor network connectivity in some parts of the conference venue.<br>
            - Interactions between remote and in-person attendees was difficult.<br>
            - Privacy challenges emerged for the remote attendees because they were present in a mixed-context (at home and at a conference)<br>

  			<div class="col-md-6">
    	  		<br><span id="med">Goals</span><br>
    	  		-We are planning to explore both dedicated robot and time shared robot usage.  Shared robot usage involves remote attendees signing up for a number of sessions that they want to attend and then using the robots for only those sessions as opposed to the entire conference. Thus, having an understanding of how time-shared vs. dedicated robots is critical to knowing which model would best serve conferences in the future.<br><br>
            - We are considering new mechanisms to allow remote attendees to represent their identity within the robots. Early ideas include exploring additional attachments to the robots such as a tablet display to show items selected by the attendee or having sensor-embedded items attached to the robot.  We want to understand how these augmentations affect attendees' feelings of self-representation. <br><br>
            - We plan to include a form of social training with remote attendees to provide them with knowledge of the interaction and navigation challenges they are likely going to experience and ways to help circumvent issues. <br><br>
            - We are hoping to make it possible for remote attendees to come to the conference reception to explore broader social interactions in this type of setting.
